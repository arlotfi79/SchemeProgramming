This repository provides the implementation for some examples and a number of useful functions using the Scheme programming language.  
[Racket IDE](https://racket-lang.org/) has been used to write the codes. 
There is also an [intelliJ plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10171-scheme) available to the Scheme programming language.  

:warning: These codes were written for the Design & Implementation of Programming Languages course in Spring 2022.
